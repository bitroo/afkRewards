# afkRewards
An intuitive Minecraft plugin to reward users for time afk.

afkRewards is a plugin that rewards players for being AFK in a designated WorldGuard-protected area. Simply install the plugin and create a WorldGuard region named "afk" around the desired pool or lake. Players can earn money and a crate by staying AFK for a set amount of time. If you need help, our team is available on Discord [https://discord.gg/dydTHQ8Wv6]. Delete the "AFKPool" folder before updating the plugin. AFK Pool / Lake benefits both players and server owners by encouraging longer server sessions. Download the plugin now to reward your players for their AFK time!
